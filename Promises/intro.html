    /*
promise is very useful when we are dealing with asynchronous operations
in js, A Promise can be thought as a container which has to be fills with 
the data after
some time or may not fills.

in short , it is an object  representing the eventual completions or failure of an operation
object which will br filled after some time
*/
//with out promise ,we can handle the asyc operations using callbacks fun
//for eg. 

const cart=['shoes', 'food', 'phone','tv'];

//we want to create a order at the backend side and

//  createOrder(cart,(OrderId)=>{
//      GoToPaymentPage(OrderId);
// })

//this above solution might creates an issue like after cart/orderID is created
//next GoToPaymentPage() method may take time to complete the transaction and
//there might be chances that gotoPayment() will further calling the ANOTHER 
//CALLBACK fUNCTION and so on...
//this problem we can called as a inversion of control.

//promises helps us to provides way to avoid such problem

// let promise=createOrder(cart);  //API -createOrder
//promise is an Object , initially it might undefined and  when the promise
//the resolved it will filled with the data
// console.log(promise)

let data=fetch("https://api.github.com/users/arunkumar201")
console.log(data)
